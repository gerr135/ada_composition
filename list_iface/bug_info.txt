NOTE on gnat bug:
The specific conversion was not intended to be used seriously. I just wanted to test how 
compiler would complain if I attempt it (since I was at this point in the code nyway).
But it is supposed to handle this gracely anyway, so this source tag (which I'll save in 
a separate branch) contains all the relevant code as it was at the point of failure.


here is the text that was spit out by the compiler
